!     subroutine chkder

!     this subroutine checks the gradients of m nonlinear functions
!     in n variables, evaluated at a point x, for consistency with
!     the functions themselves. the user must call chkder twice,
!     first with mode = 1 and then with mode = 2.

!     mode = 1. on input, x must contain the point of evaluation.
!               on output, xp is set to a neighboring point.

!     mode = 2. on input, fvec must contain the functions and the rows of fjac
!                         must contain the gradients of the respective
!                         functions each evaluated at x, and fvecp must contain
!                         the functions evaluated at xp.
!               on output, err contains measures of correctness of the
!                          respective gradients.

!     the subroutine does not perform reliably if cancellation or rounding
!     errors cause a severe loss of significance in the evaluation of a
!     function.  Therefore, none of the components of x should be unusually
!     small (in particular, zero) or any other value which may cause loss of
!     significance.

!     the subroutine statement is

!       subroutine chkder(m, n, x, fvec, fjac, xp, fvecp, mode, err)

!     where

!       m is a positive integer input variable set to the number of functions
!         (i.e. the number of cases in most applications).

!       n is a positive integer input variable set to the number of variables.

!       x is an input array of length n.

!       fvec is an array of length m.  On input when mode = 2,
!         fvec must contain the functions evaluated at x.

!       fjac is an m by n array. on input when mode = 2,
!         the rows of fjac must contain the gradients of
!         the respective functions evaluated at x.

!       ldfjac is a positive integer input parameter not less than m
!         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac.

!       xp is an array of length n.  On output when mode = 1,
!         xp is set to a neighboring point of x.

!       fvecp is an array of length m.  On input when mode = 2,
!         fvecp must contain the functions evaluated at xp.

!       mode is an integer input variable set to 1 on the first call and 2 on
!         the second.  Other values of mode are equivalent to mode = 1.

!       err is an array of length m. on output when mode = 2, err contains
!         measures of correctness of the respective gradients.  If there is
!         no severe loss of significance, then if err(i) is 1.0 the i-th
!         gradient is correct, while if err(i) is 0.0 the i-th gradient is
!         incorrect.  For values of err between 0.0 and 1.0, the categorization
!         is less certain.  In general, a value of err(i) greater than 0.5
!         indicates that the i-th gradient is probably correct, while a value
!         of err(i) less than 0.5 indicates that the i-th gradient is probably
!         incorrect.

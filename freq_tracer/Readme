Program for extracting frequency and amplitude of a pulsed NMR signal.
======================================================================

Signal is processed in parts (more then one period each). For each part
amplitude and phase (as a polinomial function of time) are restored.
These values are used to build initial condition for a next part.

Processing of each part includes following steps:

- Signal can be filtered using dameped oscillator tuned to the initial
frequency. State of oscillator is kept between parts.

- Approximate signal is built from initial values of phase, amplitude
and frequency.

- Amplitude adjustment. For each signal point below some level (0.5
amplitude) phase difference with approximate signal is found. There is
some period counting technique which helps in case of large difference.
Phase difference is fitted with quadratic function wich gives also a
linear function for frequency difference.

- Approximate signal is adjusted according to found values.

- Amplitude adjustment. For each signal point above some level (0.5
amplitude) amplitude with approximate signal is found. It is fitted with
linear function da=da*t.

- Adjusted values are prented and used as an initial condition for the
next part.
